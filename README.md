we are provided with a dataset with 300 random variables (each drawn from [0,1]). A secret algorithm was used to compute a binary target variable based on these data.
The training dataset has 250 rows, and the test dataset has 19,750 rows. The goal is to build a model based on the training dataset that
accurately classifies the test dataset.


### For variable selection
### Don't overfit!
